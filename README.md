# LambdaHackathon
Lambda School Winter 2020 Hackathon Project "Assignment Database"  Students in public and private education systems are all on the journey toward careers and need a better bridge from educational institutions to professional institutions. Assignment Database allows students and the teachers to track the student’s natural talents and/or proclivities together, throughout the student’s educational career, and to build the student a data-based map to a natural, well-fitted career based on the student’s educational performance.
